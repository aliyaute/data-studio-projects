SUPREME COURT'S USE OF TERM "ILLEGAL ALIEN" AND HOW IT SHAPES PUBLIC OPINION


Supreme Court Justices’ use of term illegal ‘alien’ sends a certain message to the public,  with the term influencing law,  policy, and perception. I wanted to see how often the judges use the term legal/illegal alien vs. person/individual/human being in cases pertaining to immigration.

To do this I downloaded immigration related cases from the Supreme Court cases between the years of 2010-2018. 
Then converted the PDF to TXT files. 
To see from which lower courts immigration related cases originate, I used Regular Expressions to extract the location information.
By using RegEx I extracted the name of the
- case
- date of the opinion
- name of the Justice presiding over the opinion
and the frequency of their use of following term: 'Alien', 'Noncitizen', 'Person', 'Individual', 'Human'


The final visualizations show that Republican appointed justices, led by Alito, are the most frequent users of term “illegal alien’ in their opinions. Democrat appointed Justice Sotomayor is the Justice who uses “noncitizen” in her opinions the most. In a 2016 interview to NPR, Sotomayor said the following:

“Illegal immigrant" has a sense, I think, in people's minds, that immigrants are all criminals and criminals in a negative sense of drug addicts, thieves, and murderers. And I felt that it was time to change the conversation from the public perception of undocumented aliens as being that kind of criminal. When you litter, you break the law, when you cross the street on a red light, you break the law. When you get a speeding ticket, you break the law. There are countless ways in which people break the law and there are gradations of how serious those violations are. I thought that it was time to be talking about what kind of violation it was.

A registered Republican when appointed by President Nixon, Justice Stevens was considered to have been on the liberal side of the aisle throughout his civil liberties rulings. Like Sotomayor, Stevens is the frequent user of term “noncitizen” and used the term “alien” the least.

With the Supreme Court, language is the essence when it comes to how the law is defined and measured. My focus on opinions stemmed from Justices’ careful choice of words in writing of these opinions.
